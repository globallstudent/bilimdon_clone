# Bilimdon Project

## Overview
Bilimdon is a project built using FastAPI, designed to provide a robust and efficient backend for managing educational resources. This project adheres to modern development practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## Features
- **FastAPI Framework**: Leverages the speed and simplicity of FastAPI.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports high-performance asynchronous operations.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a clean and well-documented API for client interaction.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bilimdon.git
    cd bilimdon
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the required environment variables. For example:
      ```
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
      SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
      ```

5. Apply database migrations using Alembic:
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

6. Run the application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

## Usage
- Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` (ReDoc).
- Use the endpoints to interact with the backend.
